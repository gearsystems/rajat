After thorough analysis of User Experience with head over to designing of Wireframes. 

Sudheesh and me started discussing about the different pages UX/UI. We wanted to keep it simple so that user won't face any difficult while using the system. We designed Various Wireframes for different Pages on paper and come up with finalise wireframes design for different pages after the whole day deep discussion on it.
